            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Science fiction has long been a genre that explores the boundaries of the unknown, delving into concepts of space, time, technology, and humanity's evolution. One of the most fascinating aspects of science fiction is its ability to predict and alter the future, shaping our imagination and, in some cases, influencing real-world innovations.</p>

        <section id="predicting">
            <h2>Predicting the Future</h2>
            <p>From Jules Verne's fantastical voyages to Arthur C. Clarke's visionary satellites, science fiction has often acted as a mirror reflecting potential futures. In many cases, authors have foreseen technological advancements, like the smartphone, which was predicted decades before its creation. The genre has the unique power to explore speculative ideas and test them against the world we live in, predicting everything from AI to space travel.</p>

        <section id="altering">
            <h2>Altering the Future</h2>
            <p>Science fiction doesn't only predict the future, it often actively shapes it. Technologies that once seemed far-fetched, such as artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, or virtual reality, were first introduced in science fiction novels and films. These ideas have motivated scientists, engineers, and innovators to bring these fictional technologies into reality. Science fiction gives us a roadmap to imagine a future that challenges the status quo and creates new possibilities.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The genre of science fiction is more than just entertainment; it's a tool for exploration, prediction, and inspiration. By looking at the future through the lens of science fiction, we not only glimpse what's possible but also gain insight into how our choices today can alter the path of tomorrow. As technology continues to evolve, so too will the future imagined in the pages of our favorite sci-fi stories.</p>
